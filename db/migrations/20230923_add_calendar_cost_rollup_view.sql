-- Comment: This view and function allow for detailed cost tracking of calendar assignments
-- You can run queries like:
--
-- 1. Get costs for a specific project:
-- SELECT * FROM calendar_assignment_costs
-- WHERE entity_type = 'project' AND entity_id = 'your_project_id';
--
-- 2. Get costs for a specific date range:
-- SELECT entity_id, entity_type, SUM(hours) as total_hours, SUM(cost) as total_cost
-- FROM calendar_assignment_costs
-- WHERE event_date BETWEEN '2023-09-01' AND '2023-09-30'
-- GROUP BY entity_id, entity_type
-- ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
--
-- 3. Get costs by assignee type:
-- SELECT assignee_type, SUM(cost) as total_cost
-- FROM calendar_assignment_costs
-- WHERE event_date BETWEEN '2023-09-01' AND '2023-09-30'
-- GROUP BY assignee_type;
