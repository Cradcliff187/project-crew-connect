# Estimate Revision System Fixes

This update improves the Estimate Revision workflow to address several critical issues with item tracking, deletion, and calculation accuracy.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed Item Deletion

- Items from previous revisions are now properly tracked when deleted instead of disappearing
- UI properly filters out deleted items while maintaining them in the database for history
- Visual feedback shows which items are being removed during the revision process

### 2. Improved Calculation Accuracy

- Added comprehensive recalculation function to ensure all values stay in sync
- Fixed issues with unit price and markup calculations
- Ensured totals are always updated when any value changes

### 3. Added Data Lineage Tracking

- New `source_item_id` column tracks where each item originated from
- Allows for better history and audit capabilities
- Enables future functionality to compare changes between revisions

### 4. Deduplication Logic

- Prevents duplicate items from being saved in the database
- Uses both original_id and item properties for robust deduplication
- Provides user feedback when duplicates are detected and removed

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes

1. **EstimateItemFields.tsx**

   - Added tracking of deleted/modified states
   - Improved the item rendering to filter out deleted items
   - Added comprehensive calculation function

2. **EstimateRevisionDialog.tsx**

   - Updated the save process to respect the deleted/modified flags
   - Added deduplication logic
   - Enhanced tracking of item origins via source_item_id

3. **Database Schema**
   - Added source_item_id column to estimate_items table
   - Added index for better query performance
   - Documented the purpose of the new column

## Benefits

- **Data Integrity**: Ensures consistent calculations and prevents duplicate items
- **Better User Experience**: Clearer feedback during deletion and validation
- **Improved Traceability**: Better tracking of item changes between revisions
- **Increased Reliability**: More predictable behavior when creating revisions

## How to Apply the Changes

1. **Code Updates**
   The following files have been updated:

   - `src/components/estimates/components/EstimateItemFields.tsx`
   - `src/components/estimates/detail/dialogs/EstimateRevisionDialog.tsx`

2. **Database Migration**
   Apply the new migration to add the source_item_id column:

   ```bash
   # Set your Supabase credentials
   export SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
   export SUPABASE_KEY=your_service_role_key

   # Run the migration
   node db/scripts/apply-migration.js
   ```

## Testing Instructions

1. Create a new estimate with multiple line items
2. Create a revision for that estimate
3. Try deleting some items in the revision
4. Try modifying other items
5. Save the revision and verify the changes were applied correctly
6. Create another revision from the previous one
7. Verify item lineage is maintained

## Future Improvements

- Add visual indicators for new vs. modified items in the UI
- Implement a revision comparison view using the source_item_id tracking
- Add ability to restore deleted items from previous revisions
