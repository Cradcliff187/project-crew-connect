# Calendar Sync Fix - Pull Request

## Summary

This PR fixes the calendar sync functionality that was previously failing with a 500 Internal Server Error when calling `POST /api/schedule-items/{id}/sync-calendar`. The fix includes improvements to environment variable handling, proper authentication with Google APIs, and database write-back.

## Changes Made

### Phase 1: Fix Backend Server and Database Integration

1. **Environment Variables**:

   - Fixed environment variable loading by ensuring proper path to `.env.local` file
   - Updated Supabase client initialization to use the correct `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

2. **Google Service Account Authentication**:

   - Implemented proper handling of service account credentials for background operations
   - Added fallback path to credentials in the credentials directory

3. **Database Fix**:

   - Fixed the `moddatetime()` trigger function which was preventing updates to the `google_event_id` field
   - Added a migration script to ensure the fix persists across environments
   - Properly updated the schedule item with the Google Calendar event ID

4. **Calendar Integration Verification**:
   - Verified that the calendar sync endpoint can successfully create events in Google Calendar
   - Confirmed that the `google_event_id` is properly stored in the `schedule_items` table
   - Added evidence to RCA.md showing successful integration

### Phase 2: Code Consolidation and Tests

1. **Calendar Helper Consolidation**:

   - Created a consolidated `calendar-helper.js` module that can be used by both frontend and backend
   - Implemented a comprehensive API for calendar operations (list, create, update, delete, sync)
   - Added proper error handling and edge case management

2. **Unit Tests**:

   - Added comprehensive unit tests for the calendar helper module
   - Used sinon for mocking the Google Calendar API responses
   - Tested all key functionality: list, create, update, delete, and sync operations

3. **Integration Tests**:

   - Created integration tests that verify the full cycle of:
     - Creating a schedule item in the database
     - Creating a Google Calendar event
     - Writing back the Google event ID to the database
     - Retrieving the event from Google Calendar using the stored ID

4. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - Enhanced error handling and logging
   - Added comprehensive JSDoc comments
   - Improved type safety and parameter validation

## Testing Done

1. Verified database write-back works correctly
2. Confirmed successful creation of Google Calendar events
3. Validated that `google_event_id` is stored in the `schedule_items` table
4. Tested the full push/pull cycle with the AKC Projects calendar
5. Ran unit and integration tests for the consolidated calendar helper

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies to restrict anonymous access
2. Add more comprehensive error handling for edge cases
3. Consider adding a retry mechanism for failed API calls
4. Add frontend UI improvements for better user feedback during sync operations
