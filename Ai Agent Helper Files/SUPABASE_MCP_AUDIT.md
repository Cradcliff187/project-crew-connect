# Supabase MCP Audit Report

This document provides a comprehensive audit of all files in the codebase related to MCP, Supabase, SQL schema, or agent behavior. The goal is to identify and catalog every file that might influence or confuse the Cursor agent or MCP when interacting with Supabase.

## Configuration Status Update (Latest)

The MCP configuration has been updated to use environment variables for authentication which should resolve the connection issues. The following key changes were made:

1. Changed from direct parameter passing (`--access-token`) to environment variable (`SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`)
2. Updated the access token to the latest value
3. Updated start command to use a single CMD command with environment variable

## MCP Configuration Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Authentication Method**:

   - The previous configuration was passing the access token directly via command-line arguments
   - Changed to use environment variables which is more secure and reliable

2. **Access Token**:

   - Updated to use the latest access token
   - Validated that the token format is correct

3. **Command Execution**:
   - Combined commands to properly set environment variables in Windows CMD
   - Simplified the command syntax to avoid potential escaping issues

## Connection Validation Status

The following steps were performed to validate MCP connectivity:

1. ✅ Cleaned up all old MCP-related files by moving them to the archive
2. ✅ Terminated any running MCP servers to ensure a clean start
3. ✅ Updated MCP configuration to use proper environment variables
4. ⏳ Testing tools access (pending)

## Recommended Final Actions

1. Restart Cursor after the configuration changes
2. Test MCP tools using:
   ```json
   { "type": "list_tables" }
   { "type": "list_columns", "table": "vendors" }
   { "type": "exec_sql", "sql": "SELECT * FROM vendors LIMIT 3;" }
   ```
3. Monitor the Cursor interface to verify "Tools available" status

If further issues persist, additional troubleshooting steps are documented in the `README_SUPABASE_MAINTENANCE.md` file.

## Credentials and Security

The following files contain sensitive credentials:

1. `.cursor/mcp.json` - Contains Supabase Personal Access Token (PAT)
2. `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` - Contains Supabase URL and API Key
3. `test-connection.js` - Contains Supabase URL and Service Role Key
4. `tools/schema-validation/enhanced-schema-validator.js` - Contains Supabase URL and Publishable Key
5. `db/scripts/full-schema-validator.js` - Contains Supabase URL and Publishable Key
6. `db/scripts/schema-validator.js` - Contains Supabase URL and Publishable Key
7. `db/scripts/schema-validator-employees.js` - Contains Supabase URL and Publishable Key
8. `db/scripts/time-entries-validator.js` - Contains Supabase URL and Publishable Key

### Security Recommendations

1. Ensure `.cursor/mcp.json` remains in `.gitignore`
2. Consider using environment variables for Supabase credentials in script files
3. Review all hardcoded keys and URLs, especially in scripts and utility files

## Identified Issues and Conflicts

1. **Hardcoded Credentials**: Several files contain hardcoded Supabase credentials which is a security risk.
2. **Legacy Documentation References**: Some documentation files reference the old MCP setup (`start-mcp.js`) which has been archived.
3. **Multiple Schema Validation Scripts**: There are multiple schema validation scripts that may have overlapping functionality.

## Recommendations

1. **Credentials Management**:

   - Move all hardcoded credentials to environment variables or secure credential storage
   - Update scripts to use environment variables consistently

2. **Documentation Update**:

   - Update all documentation to reference the current MCP setup
   - Remove or archive outdated documentation

3. **Schema Management**:

   - Consolidate schema validation scripts if possible
   - Ensure migrations are properly sequenced and documented

4. **MCP Configuration**:
   - Keep using the current Windows-compatible `.cursor/mcp.json` configuration
   - Ensure all agents are aware of the correct way to start MCP

## Conclusion

The codebase has a well-structured Supabase integration with appropriate migration files and edge functions. Most of the legacy MCP files have been correctly archived. The main concerns are around hardcoded credentials and ensuring documentation references the current setup. By addressing these issues, the codebase will have a clean, secure, and future-proof Supabase integration through MCP.
