# Current Implementation Analysis (Reports Section)

Based on analysis of `src/pages/Reports.tsx` and related search results.

## Structure & Approach

- **Main Component:** `src/pages/Reports.tsx` serves as the primary entry point.
- **Hooks:** Leverages custom hooks (`useReportData`, `useReportOptions`) to manage state, data fetching, filtering logic, and utility functions (like export).
- **Generic Components:** Relies on reusable components (`ReportPageHeader`, `ReportFilterSection`, `ReportContentSection`, `DataTable`) for UI elements.
- **Configuration Driven:** Report structure (columns, names, icons) is driven by configuration objects imported from `@/data/reportEntities`.
- **UI:** Uses horizontal `Tabs` for entity selection and conditionally displays a filter section.
- **Data Fetching:** Data fetching logic is abstracted into `useReportData` and likely uses React Query and a `fetchReportData` utility function (needs further inspection).
- **Filtering:** Filters are managed by `useReportData` and seem to be applied during data fetching (potentially debounced for server-side execution).
- **Export:** Provides CSV export functionality via `useReportOptions`.

## Issues & Observations

- **Lack of Specificity:** The highly generic approach might hinder the implementation of report-specific features, layouts, and calculations outlined in the rebuild plan.
- **No Dedicated Report Components:** Does not use separate components for each report type (e.g., `ProjectsReport`, `CustomersReport`), making customization harder.
- **Data Fetching Abstraction:** The actual database queries and their optimization level are hidden within `fetchReportData` and need investigation.
- **Client/Server Operations:** The balance between client-side and server-side filtering/sorting needs clarification.
- **Missing Features:** Lacks data visualization (charts) and PDF export capabilities as requested in the plan.
- **Potential Redundancy:** The existence of a separate `ReportBuilder` feature (`src/pages/ReportBuilder.tsx`) might overlap or conflict with this standard reports view.

## Conclusion

The current implementation provides a basic, configuration-driven reporting framework. However, it lacks the specific components and potentially the tailored query capabilities required for the detailed reports outlined in the rebuild plan. The rebuild will involve either heavily modifying these existing hooks and components or creating new, dedicated components and data-fetching logic for each report type as initially planned.
