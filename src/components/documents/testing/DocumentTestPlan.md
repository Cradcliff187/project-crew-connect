## Test Execution

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure test environment is set up with proper permissions
2. Create test data for each entity type
3. Prepare test files for upload (PDF, images, documents)

### Test Process

1. Execute component tests
2. Execute entity-specific document section tests
3. Execute migration and validation tool tests
4. Execute integration tests
5. Execute performance tests
6. Execute mobile and responsive tests
7. Test error scenarios

### Test Reporting

- Document test results for each category
- Capture screenshots of issues
- File bug reports for any failures
- Track test coverage and completion
