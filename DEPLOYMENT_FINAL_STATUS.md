```

## Verification Steps Completed

1. **Database Migration Applied**:

   - Ran `apply-migration-supabase.js` successfully
   - Verified `subname` column exists and mirrors `company_name`
   - Index created for performance

2. **Payee Selection Testing**:

   - Vendors searchable by `vendorname`
   - Subcontractors searchable by both `company_name` and `subname`
   - No more 400 errors when selecting payees

3. **UI Updates Verified**:
   - Labels show "Payee Category" instead of "Vendor Type"
   - Options show "Independent Contractor" instead of "Subcontractor"

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Supabase Status**:

   - Check https://status.supabase.com for infrastructure updates
   - The API issues appear to be temporary

2. **Future Improvements**:
   - Gradually migrate frontend code to use `company_name` directly
