# Root Cause Analysis: Calendar Sync Failure

## Error Timeline

1. When a user attempts to sync a schedule item with Google Calendar, the frontend makes a POST request to:

   ```
   POST /api/schedule-items/{id}/sync-calendar
   ```

2. The request fails with a 500 Internal Server Error

   ```
   POST /api/schedule-items/{id}/sync-calendar â†’ 500 (Internal Server Error)
   Error: Failed to fetch schedule item. DB Error: TypeError: fetch failed
   ```

3. The error occurs in the server-side endpoint that handles calendar synchronization.

## Error Stack Trace

From analyzing the server code, the error is occurring at this specific point in `server/server.js`:

```javascript
// 1. Fetch the schedule item from Supabase
const { data: item, error: itemError } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('schedule_items')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', itemId)
  .single();

if (itemError) {
  console.error('[Calendar Sync] Supabase error fetching schedule item:', itemError); // Log the full error object
  throw new Error(`Failed to fetch schedule item. DB Error: ${itemError.message}`);
}
```

The error message `TypeError: fetch failed` indicates that the fetch operation to the Supabase API is failing.

## Suspected Causes (Ranked by Likelihood)

1. **Supabase Connection Configuration (Most Likely)**

   - The error "fetch failed" suggests a network-level failure when connecting to Supabase
   - There appears to be a mismatch between environment variables in `env-template.txt` and `server-env.txt`
   - The Supabase client may not be properly initialized with the correct credentials

2. **Authentication Issues**

   - The endpoint requires authentication (`requireAuth` middleware)
   - The error could be due to missing or expired authentication tokens

3. **Network/Firewall Issues**

   - There might be network restrictions preventing the server from connecting to Supabase

4. **Schedule Item Data Structure Problems**

   - If the database schema has changed but the code hasn't been updated

5. **Missing Environment Variables**
   - Required environment variables for Supabase or Google Calendar API might be missing

## Most Likely Root Cause

The primary issue appears to be a **Supabase connection configuration problem**. The error message "TypeError: fetch failed" indicates that the server can't establish a connection to the Supabase API.

Specific contributing factors:

1. **Environment Variables Mismatch**:

   - `env-template.txt` references `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `server-env.txt` uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` (different naming)

2. **Supabase Client Initialization**:

   - Examining the code in `server.js`, the supabaseAdmin client is initialized, but there may be issues with how it's configured
   - The error occurs at the very first database query, indicating the connection itself is failing

3. **Cross-Origin Issues**:
   - There might be CORS-related issues when the server tries to communicate with Supabase

## Next Steps for Investigation

1. Verify that the Supabase project exists and is accessible
2. Check that environment variables match between configuration files and actual environment
3. Examine how the Supabase client is initialized in the server code
4. Test a simple Supabase query directly to isolate if the issue is specific to the schedule items table
5. Check for any network restrictions or proxies that might be blocking connections

## High-Level Solution Approach

1. **Fix Supabase Connection Issues**:

   - Ensure environment variables are consistently named and properly set
   - Verify Supabase project exists and is correctly configured
   - Check that service role key has necessary permissions

2. **Improve Error Handling**:

   - Add better error handling in the sync endpoint to provide more detailed error messages
   - Implement retry logic for transient connection issues

3. **Standardize Calendar Integration**:

   - Consolidate the duplicate calendar implementations (frontend calendarService.ts and server-side code)
   - Create a unified approach to Google Calendar integration

4. **Add Logging and Monitoring**:

   - Implement detailed logging for calendar sync operations
   - Add monitoring to detect failures in real-time

5. **Update Documentation**:
   - Document the correct environment variables required for both frontend and server
   - Create a troubleshooting guide for calendar integration issues
