# Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) Validation Report

## Overview

This report documents the findings from validating Row Level Security (RLS) policies on tables related to the calendar sync functionality. The tests compare access using a service role key versus an anonymous key to verify that proper security policies are in place.

## Test Methodology

1. Query the schedule_items table and related RPCs using:

   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (admin access)
   - SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (public/anonymous access)

2. Document the SQL queries used and their results
3. Review existing RLS policies and recommend any necessary changes

## Schedule Items Table RLS Test

### SQL Used for Testing

```sql
-- Basic select query to test access
SELECT id, title, description FROM schedule_items LIMIT 5;

-- Check if calendar-related fields are accessible
SELECT id, title, google_event_id, calendar_integration_enabled FROM schedule_items LIMIT 5;
```

### Test Results

#### Using Service Role Key

To be completed once the .env file is properly set up with both SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, and when access to the Supabase dashboard is available.

#### Using Anonymous Key

To be completed once the .env file is properly set up with both SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, and when access to the Supabase dashboard is available.

## Calendar-Related RPC Tests

### RPCs Identified

The following RPCs related to calendar functionality were identified:

1. `sync_schedule_item_to_calendar` - To be tested
2. `get_calendar_events` - To be tested

### Test Results

To be completed once the .env file is properly set up with both SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, and when access to the Supabase dashboard is available.

## Existing RLS Policies

### schedule_items Table Policies

To be completed once access to the Supabase dashboard is available.

## Recommendations

Based on the investigation so far, we recommend:

1. Ensure the calendar sync endpoint uses the service role key for database operations
2. Implement proper RLS policies for schedule_items table if not already in place
3. Consider adding an organization_id field to the schedule_items table to enable organization-based RLS
4. Add logging for RLS policy violations to help debug access issues

## Next Steps

1. Complete RLS validation once full access to the environment is available
2. Document all identified RLS policies
3. Provide specific SQL for implementing any missing or incorrect RLS policies
