## Finance Quick-Wins Bundle Results

### 1. Repository-wide discovery
- No existing centralized finance utility was found
- Multiple implementations of markup calculations were identified across the codebase
- Some components were already using variance indicators but not in a standardized way

### 2. Created new standardized finance utilities
- Created `src/utils/finance.ts` with `calcMarkup` and `calcTotals` functions
- Added proper error handling for negative numbers and divide-by-zero cases
- Implemented consistent 2-decimal place rounding

### 3. Created standardized VarianceBadge component
- Created `src/components/ui/finance/VarianceBadge.tsx`
- Supports both compact and full display modes
- Includes tooltips with calculation explanation
- Color-coded: green for under budget (positive variance), red for over budget (negative variance)

### 4. Unit tests for finance utility
- Created `src/utils/__tests__/finance.test.ts`
- Test coverage for all key scenarios including:
  - Positive markup calculations
  - Zero cost handling
  - Negative input clamping
  - Decimal rounding edge cases
  - Multiple items in `calcTotals`
  - Empty array handling

### 5. Refactored components
- Updated `src/components/estimates/utils/estimateCalculations.ts` to use `calcMarkup`
- Updated `src/components/estimates/detail/EstimateLineItems.tsx` to use `calcMarkup`
- Updated `src/components/projects/budget/components/BudgetItemsTable.tsx` to use `VarianceBadge`

### 6. Additional improvements
- Added test environment with Vitest setup for modern testing
- Standardized variance calculation definition across the codebase

### Verification
- All tests are passing
- No duplicate utilities found
- All calculations maintain consistent behavior

### TODOs discovered (outside scope):
- Several more components could be refactored to use these utilities
- Consider adding additional documentation about finance calculations in the codebase
- A future task could be to further consolidate financial calculation logic
