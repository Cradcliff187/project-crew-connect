# Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) Validation Results

## Overview

This report documents the findings from validating Row Level Security (RLS) policies on tables related to the calendar sync functionality.

## Test Methodology

1. Queries were executed against the schedule_items table using:

   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (admin access)
   - SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (public/anonymous access)

2. The following queries were tested:
   - Basic select query to test general access
   - Query to access calendar-related fields

## Results

### Schedule Items Table RLS Test Results

#### Using Service Role Key

**Basic select query:**

```sql
SELECT id, title, description FROM schedule_items LIMIT 5;
```

Result: SUCCESS

**Calendar fields query:**

```sql
SELECT id, title, google_event_id, calendar_integration_enabled FROM schedule_items LIMIT 5;
```

Result: SUCCESS

#### Using Anonymous Key

**Basic select query:**

```sql
SELECT id, title, description FROM schedule_items LIMIT 5;
```

Result: SUCCESS

**Calendar fields query:**

```sql
SELECT id, title, google_event_id, calendar_integration_enabled FROM schedule_items LIMIT 5;
```

Result: SUCCESS

### Issues and Fixes

1. **Environment Variable Loading**: The server was having trouble loading environment variables from the .env.local file. This was fixed by:

   - Using the correct path to load from project root: `dotenv.config({ path: path.resolve(__dirname, '..', '.env.local') });`
   - Ensuring paths were correctly specified for file-based resources (service account JSON)

2. **RLS Policy Analysis**: Our testing showed that both the service role key and anonymous key can access the schedule_items table:

   - **SECURITY CONCERN**: The anonymous key has unrestricted access to schedule_items, including calendar-related fields
   - The service role key works correctly, which is required for the calendar sync functionality

3. **Calendar Sync Test**: We tested the calendar sync endpoint:
   - Confirmed that the server can communicate with Supabase using the service role key
   - Successfully created/updated calendar events in Google Calendar

## Recommendations

**SECURITY RISK**: The anonymous key can access the schedule_items table. RLS policies should be implemented to restrict access.

The following SQL should be applied after confirming that all functionality works correctly:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on schedule_items table
ALTER TABLE schedule_items ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy to restrict anonymous access
CREATE POLICY "restrict_anonymous_access" ON schedule_items
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    auth.role() = 'authenticated' OR
    auth.role() = 'service_role'
  );
```

For now, we'll keep the existing permissions to ensure calendar sync works, but this should be addressed in a future security update.

## Calendar Sync Functionality

The calendar sync endpoint is now functioning correctly with the service role key. The key changes were:

1. Using the correct environment variable name: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` instead of `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
2. Properly initializing the Google service account for background operations
3. Using the service account for calendar API operations rather than relying on user OAuth tokens

These changes ensure the endpoint can operate reliably even when user sessions expire.
