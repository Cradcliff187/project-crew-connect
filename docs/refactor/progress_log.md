# Calendar Integration Refactor Progress Log

## 2023-11-08 - Baseline Audit Completed

**Commit:** Preparing to commit with message "chore: baseline audit â€“ files list & schema snapshot"

**Completed:**

- Created file list of calendar-related components
- Documented current schema for calendar tables and fields
- Identified inconsistencies in the current implementation

**Next Step:**
Phase 1 - Event Data Standardization

**Notes:**

- Found multiple inconsistent database schemas for calendar events
- Identified UI component issues, particularly with AssigneeSelector
- There's no centralized calendar service layer
- Different entity types use different patterns for calendar integration

## 2023-11-08 - Phase 1: Event Data Standardization (Part 1)

**Commit:** Preparing to commit with message "feat: add unified calendar event type definitions and schema"

**Completed:**

- Created design document with standardization plan
- Defined unified TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/unifiedCalendar.ts`
- Created database migration for unified calendar events table
- Generated comprehensive ER diagram in `docs/db/event_schema.md`
- Implemented data migration strategy for existing calendar events

**Next Step:**
Create Google Calendar Service

**Notes:**

- Unified model supports all entity types (project_milestones, schedule_items, work_orders, etc.)
- Database migration includes automatic trigger to keep data in sync during transition
- Designed with both backward compatibility and forward thinking in mind
- Types include utilities for input/output operations

## 2023-11-09 - Phase 2: Google Calendar Service Implementation

**Completed:**

- Created `src/services/googleCalendarService.ts` as the centralized service for all Google Calendar operations
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Added support for all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Integrated with the unified calendar event model
- Created unit tests for all service methods

**Next Step:**
Update the AssigneeSelector Component

**Notes:**

- Service uses the unified calendar events table for all operations
- Implemented automatic fallback to organization calendar or user's primary calendar
- All methods include proper error handling with meaningful error messages
- Added retry logic for network issues to increase reliability
- Backend integration is handled through a consistent API pattern

## 2023-11-10 - Phase 3: UI Component Refactoring (Part 1)

**Completed:**

- Refactored `AssigneeSelector.tsx` to fix dropdown selection issues
- Improved component to include better event propagation handling
- Fixed type safety by integrating with unified `CalendarAssigneeType`
- Added filter functionality for improved search experience
- Created a new reusable `CalendarEventForm` component that uses the unified calendar model and service

**Next Step:**
Continue UI refactoring by updating existing calendar-related components to use the new form

**Notes:**

- `AssigneeSelector` now properly prevents dialog closing when interacting with dropdown
- Added proper event handling to stop propagation issues
- Improved type safety by leveraging the unified calendar types
- New `CalendarEventForm` handles all entity types with a consistent interface
- Added support for advanced features like all-day events and location

## 2023-11-10 - Phase 3: UI Component Refactoring (Part 2)

**Completed:**

- Refactored `ScheduleItemFormDialog.tsx` to use the new `CalendarEventForm` component
- Refactored `MilestoneFormDialog.tsx` to use the unified calendar model
- Implemented data mapping functions to convert between legacy and unified models
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing component interfaces
- Fixed TypeScript errors and improved type safety

**Next Step:**
Update calendar integration for other entity types (work orders, time entries)

**Notes:**

- Used adapter pattern to maintain backward compatibility with legacy code
- Both schedule items and milestones now use the same consistent form
- Implemented proper data conversion for both directions
- Reduced code duplication by centralizing calendar UI logic
- The new components provide a more consistent user experience

## 2023-11-11 - Phase 3: UI Component Refactoring (Part 3)

**Completed:**

- Created `WorkOrderCalendarForm.tsx` to integrate work orders with the unified calendar system
- Implemented adapter interfaces to translate between work order form data and calendar events
- Extended the calendar event interface with work order specific fields
- Improved type safety with dedicated interfaces
- Ensured location data is properly formatted from address components

**Next Step:**
Implement time entries calendar integration and complete Phase 3

**Notes:**

- Work orders have a different form structure than other entity types
- Used proper TypeScript interfaces to handle work order specific fields
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing work order form
- Location data is automatically formatted from address components
- Added support for work order specific fields such as work order number and priority

## 2023-11-11 - Phase 3: UI Component Refactoring (Complete)

**Completed:**

- Created `TimeEntryCalendarForm.tsx` to integrate time entries with the unified calendar system
- Implemented proper date/time handling for time entries
- Resolved complex type issues with proper TypeScript interface extensions
- Added support for time entry specific fields (hours worked, source entity info)
- Completed the UI component refactoring phase for all entity types

**Next Step:**
Begin Phase 4: Integration and Testing

**Notes:**

- Time entries have unique datetime handling requirements
- Implemented proper conversion between time entry time format and calendar datetime
- Addressed TypeScript challenges with entity type representation
- Used type casting strategically to maintain compatibility
- Successfully applied the adapter pattern to handle both legacy and unified data models

The completion of Phase 3 marks a significant milestone in our calendar integration refactoring. All UI components now use the unified calendar model, and we have a consistent, type-safe approach for all entity types. The next phase will focus on integration testing and validation.
