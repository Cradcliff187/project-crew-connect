# Google Calendar Integration: PR Summary

## Overview

This PR completes the Google Calendar integration with two-way sync, webhook support, and cost tracking. The implementation now supports shared calendars for both projects and work orders, with attendee management and notification controls.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Two-Way Sync Engine

- Completed `syncDownChanges()` method in `googleCalendarService.ts`
- Added incremental sync using `nextSyncToken` with proper persistence
- Implemented pagination handling for large result sets
- Added robust error handling for etag conflicts and token expiration
- Created test coverage for all sync scenarios

### 2. Webhook Entry Point

- Created Cloud Function-ready webhook handler in `supabase/functions/calendarWebhook.ts`
- Added validation for all Google Calendar webhook headers
- Implemented synchronous acknowledgement and asynchronous processing
- Added robust error logging for monitoring
- Created `sync_calendar_changes` RPC function for easy integration

### 3. Project Calendar Form

- Integrated with routing and state management
- Used `UnifiedCalendarForm` for consistent UX
- Integrated with `AttendeeSelector` for user assignment
- Added support for entity-specific calendar IDs

### 4. Attendee Notification Toggle

- Added notification preference UI control
- Implemented `sendUpdates` parameter handling
- Added RSVP status display in detail views

### 5. Cost Roll-Up View

- Created `calendar_assignment_costs` SQL view
- Implemented per-day expansion for multi-day events
- Added hour and cost calculations for different event types
- Created reporting function for easy querying
- Provided example queries for common reporting needs

## Database Changes

### New Tables

- `unified_calendar_events` - Standardized calendar events storage
- `assignments` - For tracking calendar assignments
- `sync_cursors` - For tracking sync tokens
- `push_notification_channels` - For webhook notification channels
- `calendar_settings` - For entity-specific calendar settings

### New Functions

- `calculate_work_hours()` - Calculates hours for different event types
- `get_calendar_costs_by_project()` - Reporting function for cost rollups
- `sync_calendar_changes()` - RPC function for webhook integration
- `get_entity_assignments()` - RPC function for assignments retrieval

### Views

- `calendar_assignment_costs` - For cost tracking and reporting

## Testing

- Added comprehensive unit tests for all `googleCalendarService` methods
- Created verification script for testing integration
- Tested two-way sync with event creation, update, and deletion
- Verified attendee notification preferences work correctly
- Tested cost calculation and reporting

## Next Steps

As outlined in the requirements, deployment to GCP will be handled separately. The code is now ready for deployment with TODO comments in place for the GCP configuration.

## Documentation

Added detailed documentation for:

- Integration verification steps
- Database schema and relationships
- Cost calculation methodology
- Troubleshooting guidance
