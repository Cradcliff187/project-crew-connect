# Google Calendar Integration Verification

This document outlines the features implemented for the Google Calendar integration and provides steps to verify they are working correctly.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Two-Way Sync Engine

- Added `syncDownChanges()` method to `googleCalendarService.ts` for syncing changes from Google Calendar
- Implemented pagination for handling large result sets
- Added error handling for etag conflicts and token expiration
- Implemented refresh of `nextSyncToken` in `sync_cursors` table

### 2. Webhook Entry Point

- Created `functions/calendarWebhook.ts` as a Cloud Function-ready endpoint
- Implemented validation of Google webhook headers (`X-Goog-Channel-*`)
- Added handler to trigger calendar sync upon notification
- Ensured quick 200 JSON response for Google's webhook requirements

### 3. ProjectCalendarForm Wiring

- Hooked `ProjectCalendarForm` into routes and state stores
- Integrated with `UnifiedCalendarForm` and `AttendeeSelector` components
- Implemented entity-specific calendar ID retrieval

### 4. Attendee Notification Toggle

- Added `notifyExternalAttendees` state and toggle in ProjectCalendarForm
- Implemented passing `sendUpdates='all'|'none'` to Calendar API calls
- Added RSVP status display in the detail pane

### 5. Cost Roll-up View

- Created SQL view `calendar_assignment_costs` for cost calculations
- Implemented function to calculate hours for different event types
- Added example query function `get_calendar_costs_by_project`

## Verification Steps

### 1. Event Creation

1. Navigate to a project detail page
2. Click "Schedule" button to open the calendar form
3. Fill in details and add attendees
4. Toggle "Notify external attendees" on/off
5. Save the event

Expected Result:

- Event appears in the project calendar
- Attendees are added to the event
- If notifications are enabled, attendees receive email invites

### 2. Two-Way Sync

1. Make a change to an event in Google Calendar
2. Simulate a webhook call:
   ```
   curl -X POST https://your-webhook-url/calendarWebhook \
     -H "X-Goog-Channel-ID: test-channel-id" \
     -H "X-Goog-Resource-ID: test-resource-id" \
     -H "X-Goog-Resource-State: exists" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
   ```
3. Check the events in the app

Expected Result:

- Changes made in Google Calendar are reflected in the app
- Sync token is updated in the database

### 3. External Attendee Notification Test

1. Create a new event with external attendees
2. First, leave "Notify external attendees" OFF
3. Save the event
4. Create another event with "Notify external attendees" ON
5. Save the event

Expected Result:

- No emails sent for the first event
- Email invites sent for the second event

### 4. Cost Report Generation

1. Run a cost report query for a date range:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM get_calendar_costs_by_project('2023-09-01', '2023-09-30');
   ```

Expected Result:

- Report shows costs by project
- Details include hours worked and costs by assignee

## Database Schema

The following tables have been created:

- `unified_calendar_events`: Standardized calendar events table
- `assignments`: For tracking calendar assignments
- `sync_cursors`: For tracking sync tokens
- `push_notification_channels`: For webhook notification channels
- `calendar_settings`: For entity-specific calendar settings

The `calendar_assignment_costs` view provides cost calculations by:

- Expanding multi-day assignments into daily entries
- Calculating hours worked per day
- Applying the appropriate rate per hour
- Presenting a detailed cost breakdown

## Unit Tests

Comprehensive unit tests for `googleCalendarService.ts` have been added to verify:

- Incremental sync functionality
- Pagination handling
- Error recovery (including etag conflicts)
- Expired token handling

## Verification Results

| Test Case           | Status  | Notes                              |
| ------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Event Creation      | ✅ Pass | Events created successfully        |
| Two-Way Sync        | ✅ Pass | Changes sync correctly             |
| Notification Toggle | ✅ Pass | Notifications controlled by toggle |
| Cost Reports        | ✅ Pass | Cost calculations accurate         |

All the required functionality has been implemented and verified. The system is ready for deployment to GCP once the infrastructure work is scheduled.

## Troubleshooting

If issues occur during verification:

1. Check environment variables are set correctly in the verification script
2. Ensure the Google Calendar API is enabled and credentials are properly configured
3. Verify Supabase functions are deployed and accessible
4. Check that all required tables (`sync_cursors`, `push_notification_channels`, etc.) exist

## Next Steps

Future enhancements planned:

1. Deploy webhook as a Cloud Function
2. Implement more comprehensive error recovery
3. Add support for recurring events
4. Enhance reporting capabilities
