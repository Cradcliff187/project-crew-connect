# Task Management with Calendar Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a comprehensive task management system with calendar integration for the project management application. The system allows users to create, manage, and track tasks with advanced features like assignees, priorities, and calendar sync, as well as project-wide shared calendars.

## Database Schema Updates

We've added the following schema changes:

1. Enhanced `project_milestones` table with:

   - `assignee_type` - Type of assignee (employee, vendor, or subcontractor)
   - `assignee_id` - ID of the assigned person/entity
   - `start_date` - When the task should begin
   - `priority` - Task priority (low, medium, high, urgent)
   - `status` - Task status (not_started, in_progress, completed, blocked)
   - `estimated_hours` - Estimated hours to complete the task

2. Created new tables:
   - `project_calendars` - Stores project-specific Google Calendar IDs
   - `project_calendar_access` - Manages team member access to project calendars

## TypeScript Types

- Created comprehensive TypeScript types for all new entities
- Updated existing types to support the new fields
- Added type definitions for calendar access control

## Components

### Task Management

- Enhanced `MilestoneFormDialog` to include:

  - Assignee selection
  - Priority setting
  - Status selection
  - Start/due date picking
  - Estimated hours
  - Calendar integration toggle

- Updated `ProjectMilestones` component with:

  - Advanced filtering by status, priority, and assignee
  - Sorting options
  - Improved milestone list with status badges
  - Calendar sync indicators

- Improved `MilestoneItem` to display:
  - Status and priority badges
  - Start and due dates
  - Assignee information
  - Estimated hours

### Calendar Integration

- Enhanced `CalendarIntegrationToggle` for consistent UI across the app
- Created the `AssigneeSelector` component for selecting employees, vendors, or subcontractors
- Built the `ProjectCalendarSetup` component for managing project-wide calendars and access control

## Hooks and Services

- Enhanced `useMilestones` to handle the new fields and provide filtering capabilities
- Created `useProjectCalendar` hook for managing project calendars
- Extended existing calendar integration to support project calendars

## UI Improvements

- Added filtering and sorting to the task list
- Created visual indicators for task priority and status
- Added a dedicated Calendar tab on the project detail page

## Next Steps

1. Fetch and display real employee names in the calendar access lists
2. Implement dynamic employee selection in the calendar access dialog
3. Add comprehensive filters for the assignee type in the task list
4. Create dashboard views that integrate calendar events across projects
5. Add notification settings for calendar events and task assignments
