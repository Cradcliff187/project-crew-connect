# Supabase Connection Cleanup Report

## Summary

We have completed an audit and cleanup of the Supabase connection-related files in the codebase. The primary goal was to identify the current working connection method (MCP) and remove redundant files that could cause confusion or security issues. Additionally, we organized SQL files related to the Google Calendar integration.

## Key Findings

1. **Working Connection Method**: The project successfully uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect to Supabase
2. **Configuration**: The configuration is stored in `.cursor/mcp.json` and works with the `start-mcp.js` script
3. **Redundant Files**: Several deprecated connection methods were found in the codebase
4. **Documentation**: Documentation has been created to guide future AI agents
5. **Calendar Integration**: SQL files for the Google Calendar integration were scattered across the codebase

## Actions Taken

### Files Created

1. **`docs/supabase_connection_guide_for_agents.md`**

   - Comprehensive guide for AI agents on how to use Supabase
   - Includes code examples, best practices, and safety notes

2. **`docs/supabase_file_audit.md`**

   - Complete audit of all Supabase-related files
   - Classification as required, review, or deleted

3. **`docs/calendar_integration_files_cleanup.md`**

   - Documentation of the calendar integration files organization
   - Instructions for validating and applying calendar fields

4. **`db/migrations/add_calendar_fields_to_time_entries.sql`**

   - Migration to add calendar fields to time_entries table
   - Consolidates functionality from several standalone SQL files

5. **`db/scripts/check_calendar_fields.sql`**

   - SQL script to validate calendar fields across tables

6. **`db/scripts/validate_calendar_fields.js`**

   - Script to check if all calendar fields exist

7. **`db/scripts/apply_calendar_migration.js`**
   - Script to apply missing calendar fields if needed

### Files Deleted

We safely removed 7 redundant Supabase connection files that were superseded by the current MCP approach:

1. `try_psql.js` - Direct PostgreSQL connection script
2. `direct-migration.js` - Direct migration script
3. `execute_sql.js` - SQL execution script
4. `simple-migration.js` - Simplified migration script
5. `simple_execute_sql.js` - Simplified SQL execution
6. `apply-direct-migration.js` - Direct migration application script
7. `apply-source-item-migration.js` - One-time migration script

We also removed several redundant calendar integration files:

1. `check_calendar_schema.sql` - Functionality moved to db/scripts
2. `add_calendar_fields.sql` - Redundant with existing migrations
3. `add_simple_calendar_fields.sql` - Redundant with existing migrations
4. `update_time_entries.sql` - Functionality moved to migration file
5. `fix_time_entries.sql` - Functionality moved to migration file
6. `check_calendar_schema.js` - Functionality moved to db/scripts
7. `add_missing_calendar_fields.js` - Functionality moved to db/scripts
8. `update_time_entries.js` - Functionality moved to db/scripts

### Files Preserved

Several core files were identified as essential to the working connection:

1. `.cursor/mcp.json` - MCP configuration
2. `supabase/functions/proxy.js` - MCP proxy script
3. `start-mcp.js` - Script to launch the MCP server
4. Various utility scripts in the `db/` directory

## Connection Details

The current Supabase connection uses these details:

- **Project ID**: zrxezqllmpdlhiudutme
- **Project Name**: AKC Revisions
- **Connection Method**: MCP proxy via `@supabase/mcp-server-supabase`
- **Database Role**: mcp_role
- **Host**: zrxezqllmpdlhiudutme.supabase.co

## Calendar Integration

The Google Calendar integration is now properly organized with:

- **Migration files** in `db/migrations/` for adding calendar fields to different tables
- **Validation scripts** in `db/scripts/` for checking and applying calendar fields
- **Documentation** in `docs/calendar_integration_files_cleanup.md`

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Standardize on MCP**: Use the MCP approach as the standard method for all database operations
2. **Documentation Updates**: Reference only current working methods in all documentation
3. **Further Cleanup**: Continue reviewing the files marked for review
4. **Security**: Regularly rotate the database role password and access tokens
5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for database operations
6. **Validation**: Create additional validation scripts to verify database schema
7. **Migration Consolidation**: Consider consolidating all calendar-related migrations into a single file

## Conclusion

The codebase has been successfully cleaned up and organized. The Supabase connection setup is working correctly and is well-documented. The Google Calendar integration files have been consolidated into the proper directories. All redundant files have been safely removed, and a clear path forward has been established for database operations and calendar integration.
