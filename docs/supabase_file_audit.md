# Supabase Files Audit

This document provides an assessment of Supabase-related files in the codebase and their relevance to the current working setup.

## Core Files (✅ Required)

These files are essential for the current working MCP setup and should not be modified without careful consideration:

## Deleted Files (🗑️ Removed)

| File                             | Purpose                      | Status     | Reasoning                                          |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `try_psql.js`                    | Direct PostgreSQL connection | 🗑️ Deleted | Superseded by MCP and not used in current workflow |

## Next Steps

1. Continue to review the remaining ⚠️ files to determine if they are still needed
2. Update documentation to reference only the current working methods for Supabase interaction
3. Use the MCP approach as the standard method for database operations
4. Ensure all team members and AI agents are aware of the Supabase connection guide
