## ðŸ”§ Priority Project: Payee-Selection & Expense-Tracking Flow Fix

### Context / Known Issues

1. **400 Error**: Selecting "Independent contractor" triggers `GET /rest/v1/subcontractors?select=subid,subname,status...` â†’ 400 (Postgres 42703) - `subname` column doesn't exist
2. **Misleading Labels**: "Vendor type" label is inconsistent with Supabase schema
3. **Broken References**: Receipt-upload & expense records depend on mismatched columns

### Deliverables

#### 1. Schema Alignment

- [ ] Audit `vendors` & `subcontractors` tables for column consistency
- [ ] Ensure both tables expose a common `name` field (column or view/alias)
- [ ] Create migration SQL if renames/additions needed

#### 2. API Refactor

- [ ] Update Supabase queries to use `select=id,name,status`
- [ ] Remove `subname` references and empty `ilike` filter
- [ ] Add defensive checks for blank search terms

#### 3. UI/UX Changes

- [ ] Rename dropdown label from "Vendor type" to "Payee category"
- [ ] Update options: "Company vendor" â†” `vendors`, "Independent contractor" â†” `subcontractors`
- [ ] Implement autocomplete from unified `name` field
- [ ] Add toast notifications on fetch failures

#### 4. Expense & Upload Flows

- [ ] Store `payee_id` + `payee_category` in expense records
- [ ] Link receipt-upload to chosen payee
- [ ] Update TypeScript types accordingly

#### 5. Testing & Validation

- [ ] Create unit tests for new API hooks
- [ ] Add E2E tests: select payee types, upload receipts, verify DB writes
- [ ] Ensure zero console errors

### Pre-Work Analysis Required

#### A. Schema Inventory

- [ ] Run schema introspection query
- [ ] Create hierarchy trees for expense and payee domains
- [ ] Document all foreign-key relationships
- [ ] Deliver tree BEFORE migrations

#### B. Impact Map

- [ ] List all affected files/modules
- [ ] Document required changes per file
- [ ] Include migrations, seeds, fixtures, tests

### Success Criteria

- âœ… No 400 errors when selecting payees
- âœ… Expense & upload flows link correctly
- âœ… All tests pass in CI
- âœ… Schema and impact map approved

## Notes

- Work on this branch: `feature/post-deployment-fixes`
- Test changes locally before pushing
- Each fix should be a separate commit
- Create PR when ready to merge to main
