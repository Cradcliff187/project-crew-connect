# Google Calendar Shared-ID Validation & Integration Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the findings and actions taken during the audit of the Google Calendar integration, specifically focusing on the AJC Projects shared calendar ID. The audit identified the storage locations for shared calendar IDs, implemented mechanisms to update them, and documented how these IDs are consumed by the application.

## Findings

### 1. Database Schema

Shared Google Calendar IDs are stored in the following tables:

- **`organization_calendar`**: Stores organization-wide calendar settings, including the Google Calendar ID.
- **`project_calendars`**: Stores project-specific calendar settings.
- **`calendar_access`** / **`project_calendar_access`**: Control access permissions.

### 2. Calendar ID Usage

The Google Calendar ID is used in multiple areas of the codebase:

- **Server API**: The ID is passed to calendar API endpoints in the `calendarId` or `targetCalendarId` parameter.
- **Calendar Helper**: `server/google-api-helpers/calendar.js` accepts a `targetCalendarId` parameter.
- **Frontend Hooks**: Several hooks handle calendar operations, including `useOrganizationCalendar` and `useCalendarIntegration`.

### 3. Current Implementation

- The application primarily uses a single organization-wide shared calendar.
- The calendar ID is retrieved from the database when needed for API calls.
- If no specific calendar ID is provided, the system falls back to the user's primary calendar.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Server Update Endpoint

Added an endpoint to update or create the organization calendar with the AJC Projects shared calendar ID:

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/organization-calendar/update`
- **File**: `server/server.js`
- **Functionality**: Checks if an organization calendar exists and updates it, or creates a new one with the AJC Projects calendar ID.

### 2. Utility Script

Created a utility script to facilitate updating the calendar ID:

- **Script**: `ai-agent-helpers/update-ajc-calendar.js`
- **Functionality**: Makes a request to the update endpoint and displays the results.

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation

Created detailed documentation about shared calendar integration:

- **Doc**: `docs/integrations/shared-calendar-usage.md`
- **Content**: Explains where calendar IDs are stored, how they are used, and the overall integration flow.

## Next Steps

### 1. Testing

- **Verify Update**: Run the utility script to ensure the AJC Projects calendar ID is properly stored.
- **Event Creation**: Create test events to verify they appear in the shared calendar.
- **Permission Testing**: Verify that all team members can view events in the shared calendar.

### 2. Future Improvements

- **UI Enhancements**: Add a settings interface for managing shared calendars.
- **Multiple Calendars**: Enhance the system to better support multiple shared calendars.
- **More Granular Control**: Add settings for notification preferences per calendar.
- **External Sharing**: Add functionality to share calendars with clients or external contractors.

```

### Key Files

1. **Server API**: `server/server.js`

   - Added endpoint for calendar ID updates
   - Modified to use Supabase client for database operations

2. **Database Schema**: `db/migrations/add_organization_calendar.sql`

   - Defines tables for storing calendar IDs and access controls

3. **React Hooks**:

   - `src/hooks/useOrganizationCalendar.ts`
   - `src/hooks/useCalendarIntegration.ts`
   - `src/hooks/useProjectCalendar.ts`

4. **Calendar Helper**: `server/google-api-helpers/calendar.js`
   - Provides methods for interacting with the Google Calendar API
   - Accepts calendar ID parameters

## Conclusion

The audit successfully identified how shared Google Calendar IDs are stored and used in the application. The newly implemented endpoint and utility script provide a straightforward way to update the AJC Projects shared calendar ID. The comprehensive documentation will assist team members in understanding and managing the calendar integration.
