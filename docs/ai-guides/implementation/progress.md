# Reports Section Rebuild Progress

## Current Status

- Phase/Task: Phase 1 completed, moving to Phase 2 & 3
- Completion percentage: 15%
- Current focus: Creating component structure and implementing optimized queries

## Completed Tasks

- Database schema investigation
- Current implementation analysis
- Started query design for reports

## Issues Encountered

- The current implementation uses a generic approach without specific per-report components
- Identified data for some report fields may need to be calculated rather than directly queried

## Next Steps

- Create base report components
- Implement specific report components for each report type:
  - Projects Report
  - Employees Report
  - Financials Report
  - Vendors Report
  - Subcontractors Report
- Develop optimized queries for each report
- Implement filtering, sorting and export functionality
- Add visualization components

## Plan Adjustments

- Will use existing UI component framework (appears to be shadcn-based)
- Will leverage Recharts for data visualization based on existing implementation

## Report Components Structure

### Base Components

1. **ReportContentSection** - Container for table view with search and filtering
2. **ReportFilters** - Common filters UI (date range, status, search)
3. **ReportExport** - Functionality to export data in various formats
4. **ReportVisualizations** - Reusable chart components

### Entity-Specific Report Components

#### EmployeesReport

- **Features:**
  - Employee filtering by role, status, and date range
  - KPI metrics: total employees, active employees, billable hours, revenue, utilization
  - Visualizations: role distribution, status distribution, department distribution
  - Data table with employee details and performance metrics
  - Export functionality

#### ProjectsReport

- **Features:**
  - Project filtering by status, client, manager, date range, budget
  - KPI metrics: total projects, active projects, avg completion, budget utilization
  - Visualizations: status distribution, budget vs. actual, timeline views
  - Data table with project details and financial metrics
  - Export functionality

#### FinancialsReport

- **Features:**
  - Financial filtering by date range, project, client
  - KPI metrics: revenue, costs, margins, outstanding payments
  - Visualizations: revenue trends, cost breakdown, profitability by project
  - Data table with detailed financial records
  - Export functionality

## Implementation Plan

1. Update utility functions in `reportUtils.ts` for optimized data processing
2. Implement the entity-specific report components in src/components/reports
3. Connect to data sources using the existing Supabase integration
4. Add specialized visualizations for each report type
5. Implement export functionality for CSV, Excel and PDF formats
