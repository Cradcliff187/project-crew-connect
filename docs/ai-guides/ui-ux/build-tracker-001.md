## Project Overview

- Project Name: financials-refined
- Build ID: 001
- Date Started: 2024-08-20
- Primary Goals:
  - Update project `start_date` and `due_date` appropriately in workflows.
  - Validate where these fields are in the database schema.
  - Ensure these fields can be maintained on the project pages.
  - Capture the `project_start_date` when an estimate is converted to a project.
- Expected Completion: TBD

## Build Summary

This build focused on integrating `start_date` and `target_end_date` (due date) management for projects. Key accomplishments include:

- Validated existing database schema columns (`start_date`, `target_end_date`).
- Located the estimate-to-project conversion logic within the `convert_estimate_to_project` database function.
- Modified the SQL function to set `start_date` and `target_end_date` to `NULL` upon conversion, allowing for manual planning post-creation (Corrected initial approach based on user feedback).
- Fixed bugs in the SQL function related to null `category` values and incorrect `site_location` field mapping during project creation.
- Verified frontend components (`ProjectEdit`, `ProjectForm`, `UpcomingDatesCard`) correctly handle date input and display.
- Corrected frontend payload keys (`description`, `target_end_date`, `site_*`) in `useProjectSubmit` and `ProjectEdit` to match the database schema.
- Added the missing route definition for `/projects/:projectId/edit` in `App.tsx` to fix navigation.
- Successfully tested the estimate conversion and project editing workflows with the implemented changes.

**Note:** Minor linter errors related to proper nouns (Vite, Supabase, shadcn/ui, timestamptz) persist in this Markdown file but do not affect functionality.

## Project Context

- **Frontend Framework:** React (Vite)
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui (using Radix UI + Tailwind)
- **State Management:** TanStack Query (Server State), React Hooks (Local State)
- **Form Handling:** React Hook Form + Zod
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (Assumed)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **API:** Supabase Client Library, Supabase Edge Functions

**Key Dependencies:** React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React Hook Form, Zod, TanStack Query, TanStack Table, Supabase Client, React Router.

**File Structure Summary:** Feature-based organization within `src/components/`, separation of concerns (hooks, services, types, utils), Supabase functions in `supabase/`, DB migrations in `db/migrations/`.

**Implementation Patterns:** Component-based, Functional Components + Hooks, TypeScript, Utility-first CSS, Server state management via TanStack Query.

**Database Schema:** Validated via Supabase MCP.

- `projects` table contains `start_date` (timestamptz) and `target_end_date` (timestamptz).
- `estimates` table contains `datecreated`, `sentdate`, `approveddate` (all timestamptz).

## Build Tracking File

### 1. Build Objectives and Requirements

- Primary objectives:
  - Ensure accurate `start_date` and `due_date` management for projects.
  - Implement `start_date` capture during estimate-to-project conversion.
  - Provide UI for maintaining these dates on project pages.
- Key requirements:
  - Identify relevant database columns (`start_date`, `due_date`) in the `projects` table (or equivalent).
  - Modify estimate-to-project conversion logic (likely a Supabase function or frontend service) to populate `start_date`.
  - Update project creation/edit forms/pages (`src/components/projects/...`) to include/manage `start_date` and `due_date`.
- Success criteria:
  - Project `start_date` is automatically set upon conversion from an estimate.
  - Project `start_date` and `due_date` can be viewed and edited within the project detail/edit views.
  - Dates are correctly stored in the Supabase database.

### 2. Implementation Approach

- Architectural approach:
  - Modify existing components and services/functions. No major architectural changes anticipated.
- Component strategy:
  - Update relevant form components within `src/components/projects/` (e.g., `ProjectForm`, `ProjectEdit`, potentially `CreateProjectWizard`).
  - Update display components in `src/components/projects/detail/` (e.g., `UpcomingDatesCard` or similar).
- State management approach:
  - Utilize TanStack Query for fetching/updating project data.
  - Use React Hook Form for managing form state related to dates.
- Database changes:
  - Verify existence and types of `start_date` and `due_date` columns in the `projects` table. Potentially add them if missing (unlikely but possible). -> **Confirmed: `start_date` (timestamptz) and `target_end_date` (timestamptz) exist in `projects` table.**
  - Modify estimate-to-project conversion logic (potentially a DB function).
- API enhancements:
  - Ensure Supabase queries (fetch/update) include the date fields. Modify if necessary.

### 3. Technical Specifications

- Schema changes:

```typescript
// Schema validation complete. Relevant columns:
// table: projects
//   start_date: timestamp with time zone | null
//   target_end_date: timestamp with time zone | null  (Assuming this is the 'due_date')
// table: estimates
//   (No start_date, which is expected)
```

- Component structure:

```typescript
// Modify:
// - src/components/projects/ProjectForm.tsx (or similar edit/create form)
// - src/components/projects/detail/cards/UpcomingDatesCard.tsx (or similar display card)
// - Potentially logic related to src/components/estimates/... for conversion
```

- API contracts:

```typescript
// Ensure Supabase API calls for projects (select, update, insert) handle start_date and due_date.
```

- State management:

```typescript
// Update TanStack Query cache keys/logic if necessary for project data involving dates.
// Update React Hook Form schemas (Zod) for validation.
```

### 5. Integration Points

- Supabase Integration:
  - Tables accessed: `projects`, `estimates`, `customers`, `estimate_revisions`, `estimate_items`, `project_budget_items`, `documents`
  - Functions used: `convert_estimate_to_project` (RPC)
  - Triggers used: TBD (Needs manual verification during testing)
- External Systems:
  - None identified for this build.

### 6. Known Constraints or Challenges

- Identifying the exact location and mechanism of estimate-to-project conversion.
- Ensuring date formats are consistent between UI, validation, and database.

### 7. Quality Checks and Validation Criteria

- Unit test coverage requirements: Add tests for new/modified logic if possible within the existing testing setup.
- Integration test approach: Manually test the end-to-end flows (estimate conversion, project editing).
- Manual testing scenarios:
  - Convert an estimate to a project -> Verify `start_date` is set (e.g., to today's date).
  - Create a new project -> Verify `start_date` and `due_date` can be set.
  - Edit an existing project -> Verify `start_date` and `due_date` can be updated.
  - View project details -> Verify `start_date` and `due_date` are displayed correctly.
- Performance benchmarks: N/A for this build.
