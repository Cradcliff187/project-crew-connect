# AI Agent Guides

This directory contains documentation and guides generated by AI assistance during development of the AKC Revisions project. These guides serve as references for development patterns, architecture decisions, and implementation strategies.

## Directory Structure

- **supabase/** - Guides related to Supabase database and MCP usage
- **ui-ux/** - Documentation related to UI/UX design and implementation
- **implementation/** - General implementation plans and analysis
- **google-calendar/** - Google Calendar integration documentation
- **components/** - Component-specific guides and documentation

## Purpose

These guides were created to document complex development tasks, provide implementation strategies, and maintain knowledge about system architecture. While some may contain historical information, they continue to provide valuable context about design decisions and integration strategies.

## Usage

When developing new features or debugging systems, consult these guides for:

1. Understanding the reasoning behind architectural decisions
2. Following established patterns for integrations (especially Supabase and Google Calendar)
3. Referencing UI/UX decisions and component structure

## Maintenance

As the application evolves, these guides should be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect current implementation. Obsolete guides should be moved to the `archive` directory rather than deleted, to preserve historical context.
