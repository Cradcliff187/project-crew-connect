# Calendar/Scheduling Full-Stack Audit Results

## Overview

This directory contains the results of a comprehensive audit of all calendar, scheduling, milestone, and timeline related functionality in the AKC Revisions-V1 project. The audit was conducted on May 16, 2023.

## Report Contents

1. **Audit_Report.md** - Main report with detailed findings, including:

   - Codebase mapping of calendar/scheduling files
   - Component dependency visualization
   - User journey walkthroughs
   - Static analysis and runtime checks
   - Supabase schema audit
   - Alignment matrix and gap analysis
   - Prioritized findings and implementation plan

2. **Dependency_Graph.txt** - ASCII visualization of component relationships and dependencies

3. **Schema_vs_Types.csv** - Comparison of database schema vs. front-end TypeScript types

4. **Recommended_Fixes.todo** - Prioritized list of fixes in GitHub-compatible task format

## Summary of Key Findings

1. **Critical Issues**

   - Incomplete milestone calendar integration
   - Inadequate error handling for calendar operations
   - Gaps in Supabase row-level security policies

2. **Functional Gaps**

   - Limited calendar UI functionality (multi-day events, etc.)
   - One-way Google Calendar synchronization
   - No support for recurring events

3. **Technical Debt**
   - Type definition inconsistencies
   - Insufficient test coverage
   - Missing calendar settings management UI

## Next Steps

The recommended approach is to address issues in this priority order:

1. Fix critical security/functionality issues (1-2 weeks)
2. Implement core functional improvements (2-3 weeks)
3. Address technical debt over time

All issues have been assigned tracking numbers (AKC-CAL-001 through AKC-CAL-009) for integration with project management tools.
