## Current State

âœ… **Production is LIVE and WORKING**

- URL: https://project-crew-connect-dbztoro5pq-ul.a.run.app
- OAuth: Fully configured with correct redirect URIs
- Access: Public (allUsers can access)
- All environment variables properly set

## For Future AI Agents

To understand the setup:

1. Read `PRODUCTION_SETUP_DOCUMENTATION.md` for complete details
2. Use `check-oauth-simple.ps1` to verify current configuration
3. Check `DEPLOYMENT_INFO.md` for quick status and commands

The OAuth issue was resolved by:

1. Adding the production redirect URI to Google OAuth client
2. Enabling public access on Cloud Run service
3. Ensuring all environment variables were correctly set
