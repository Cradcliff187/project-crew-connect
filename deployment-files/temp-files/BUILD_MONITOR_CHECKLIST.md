# Build Monitoring Checklist

## 🔧 Build Fix Applied

The Dockerfile has been updated to fix the TypeScript compilation error.

### What was wrong:

- `npm ci --only=production` only installs production dependencies
- TypeScript (`tsc`) is a dev dependency needed for building
- Build failed with "sh: tsc: not found"

### What was fixed:

- Build stage now runs `npm ci` to install ALL dependencies
- Production stage installs only production dependencies
- This keeps the final image small while allowing the build to succeed

## 📊 Monitor Current Build

1. **Check Build Status**

   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=crm-live-458710
   - Look for the build triggered by commit `9e3ae73c`
   - Status should change from "Building" to "Success" in ~5 minutes

2. **Expected Build Steps**

   - ✅ Fetch source
   - ✅ Build Docker image (with TypeScript compilation)
   - ✅ Push to Artifact Registry
   - ✅ Deploy to Cloud Run

3. **If Build Succeeds**

   - Visit: https://project-crew-connect-dbztoro5pq-ul.a.run.app
   - Test login functionality
   - Test address autocomplete

4. **If Build Fails Again**
   - Check the specific error in build logs
   - Common issues:
     - Missing dependencies
     - TypeScript errors
     - Docker configuration issues

## 🚀 After Successful Deployment

Remember to:

1. Update Google OAuth redirect URIs (see FIX_OAUTH_403.md)
2. Update Supabase URL configuration
3. Clear browser cache and test the application

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Commands

If you need to test the build locally:

```bash
# Build the Docker image locally
docker build -t test-build .

# Run it locally
docker run -p 8080:8080 test-build
```
